###### **Summary of Masterâ€™s Thesis**
### **_Title: Differential Effects of Airway Epithelial Damage on Aspergillus fumigatus Growth: Implications for Fungal Colonization in Compromised Airways_**

#### ðŸ”¹**Background:**
- _Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus)_ is a major respiratory pathogen, posing risks to individuals with weakened airway barriÂ ers (e.g., asthma patients).
- Damage to airway epithelial cells (AECs) can disrupt the epithelial barrier and immune defenses, potentially enhancing fungal colonization, though excessive damage may also inhibit colonization by creating an inhospitable environment.
#### ðŸ”¹**Research Objectives:**
- Assess the impact of gliotoxin, house dust mite (HDM) allergens, and staurosporine (StP) on AEC damage and fungal spore growth.
- Explore the correlation between the extent of AEC damage and fungal spore growth, providing insights into mechanisms of colonization.
- Determine whether specific damaged condition inhibit or promoted fungal growth.
- Investigate innate inflammatory responses induced by cell damage (via IL-8 levels) and their role in fungal persistence.
#### ðŸ”¹**Methods:**
- A549 human lung cells were treated with gliotoxin, HDM, and StP to model different types of damage: general fungal infection with oxidative stress, allergen-induced damage, and controlled apoptosis.
- Cytotoxicity was measured using Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays (quantitiative data).
- Spore growth was evaluated through optical density measurements (correlational data).
- Inflammatory responses were assessed by measuring interleukin-8 expression with ELISA.
- Data were analysed via GraphPad Prism through statistical tests included Shapiro-Wilk test, t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests.
#### ðŸ”¹**Results:**
- Gliotoxin:
	- Induced high and significant cytotoxicity.
	- Surprisingly inhibited or had no effect on spore growth.
	- Comparative results suggested excessive damage disrupted fungal colonization.
	- Highlighted the importance of self-protection mechanisms against exogenous gliotoxin.
- HDM:
	- Caused mild cytotoxicity with enhancing fungal spore growth.
	- Possibly altered immune signaling, creating a favorable environment for fungal persistence.
	- IL-8 levels indicated that fungal spores primarily drive the inflammatory response rather than allergens.
- Staurosporine:
	- Induced moderate apoptosis and suppressed fungal growth.
	- Suggested potential anti-fungal properties.
	- Findings align with previously reported anti-fungal properties of STP on other fungal species.
- **Conclusions**:
	- The relationship between AEC damage and fungal colonization is complex.
	- Excessive damage impairs fungal growth, while moderate damage may facilitate colonization.
	- Combination of the allergen HDM and _A. fumigatus_ did not synergistically enhance inflammation.
	- The prescence of _A. fumigatus_ spores significantly increase both cytotoxicity and IL-8 expression.
- Therapeutic strategies should:
	- Protect AEC integrity.
	- Modulate immune responses to prevent fungal persistence.
	- Findings highlight the potential for targeting immune pathways and preserving epithelial barriers in diseases like asthma.
- More research is needed on:
	- The interplay between allergic inflammatory responses and airway fungal infections.
